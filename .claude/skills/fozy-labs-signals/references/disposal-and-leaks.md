# Disposal, teardown and leaks

What holds a subscription, what must be stopped by hand, and what cleans itself up.

---

## 1. What each primitive holds

| Primitive                                   | Holds while alive                                              | How it ends                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Signal.state`                              | One `BehaviorSubject` plus its subscribers.                    | Usually nothing. `dispose()` completes it.                   |
| `Signal.compute`                            | Nothing while cold; an internal effect + dependency subs while warm. | Automatic at the last unsubscribe. `dispose()` for good. |
| `Signal.effect`                             | One subscription per tracked dependency + your teardown.       | **You must** call `unsubscribe()`.                           |
| `Signal.from`                               | One shared upstream subscription while hot; nothing when cold. | Refcount + `keepAlive`. `dispose()` ends it for good.        |
| `SourceSignal.create`                       | A fresh subscription per read and per tracking consumer.       | Ends with the consumer; the signal itself owns nothing.      |
| `LocalSignal.state`                         | An internal state + computed, plus a page-lifetime storage manager. **No `dispose()`.** | Nothing to call.        |
| `unstable_KeyedSignal` / `unstable_ProxySignal` | Lazily materialised per-key / per-path nodes.               | `dispose()`; idle nodes are reaped on their own.             |
| `s$.obs.subscribe(...)`                     | A plain RxJS subscription.                                     | `sub.unsubscribe()` or `takeUntil(destroyed$)`.              |

The single rule that matters: **an `Effect` never stops itself.** Everything else in the list either owns nothing or
releases on refcount. An effect created and forgotten keeps its dependency subscriptions — and whatever its body opened —
alive for the lifetime of the signals it reads.

---

## 2. Effect teardown

```ts
const stop = Signal.effect(() => {
  const id = this.resourceId$();
  const sub = this._ws.subscribe(id);
  return () => sub.unsubscribe(); // runs before every re-run AND on unsubscribe
});

stop.unsubscribe();
```

- The returned function runs **before each re-run** and once on `unsubscribe()`. It never runs twice for the same run.
- `Signal.effect` is declared as `(effectFn: () => void) => Effect`. Returning a teardown still type-checks (TypeScript's
  void-return rule) and is honoured at runtime. The class form `new Effect(fn)` types the teardown explicitly.
- A body that **throws** unsubscribes the effect from everything it had collected, sets `closed = true` and rethrows.
  The effect is dead; it will not resume when a dependency changes. Guard risky work inside the body if the effect must
  survive it.

---

## 3. `dispose()` on state and computed

```ts
count$.dispose();
count$.set(5);      // silently notifies nobody — the signal is completed
```

- `dispose()` completes the underlying subject: current subscribers receive `complete`, and later writes reach no one.
  It is not an error, and it is not loud — so dispose **last**, during teardown, never speculatively.
- `Computed.dispose()` also stops its internal effect and drops the memo cache.
- `Signal.from(...).dispose()` snapshots the cached value, then tears the upstream down: reads keep returning that
  frozen value and `obs` completes immediately, for existing and new subscribers alike. Disposed while cold, it has
  nothing to freeze and falls back to `default` (or throws). It is the only way to end a `keepAlive: "forever"` signal.
- Most signals no explicit disposal: cold, they hold nothing; warm, they release at the last unsubscribe.
  Dispose one when you built it for a bounded piece of work and want its cached value released immediately.

### `using`

`DisposableSignal` implements `Disposable`, so explicit resource management works:

```ts
function totalFor(ids: string[]) {
  using sum$ = Signal.compute(() => ids.reduce((n, id) => n + this.weights$()[id], 0));
  return sum$();
}
```

Requires TypeScript ≥ 5.2 and a runtime `Symbol.dispose`. The library resolves the symbol polyfill-safely
(`Symbol.dispose ?? Symbol.for("Symbol.dispose")`), which lines up only if your polyfill defines `Symbol.dispose`
**before** the library module is evaluated. When in doubt, call `dispose()` explicitly.

---

## 4. Devtools entries and GC

A `State` created with a devtools key or with custom `SignalOptions.hooks` is registered in a `FinalizationRegistry`, so
its devtools entry is closed when the signal is garbage-collected. An explicit `dispose()` unregisters the finaliser and
closes the entry immediately — no double `$COMPLETED`. Practical consequence: devtools entries do not leak either way,
but they linger until GC if you never dispose.

Neither case calls for a devtools-motivated `dispose()`: a key still held by a dead-but-uncollected signal is taken over
by its successor as a `RECREATE` — see [Devtools](../SKILL.md#6-devtools).

---

## 5. Checklist

- ✅ Every `Signal.effect` has a matching `unsubscribe()` in a teardown hook.
- ✅ Every manual `s$.obs.subscribe(...)` has a matching `unsubscribe()` (or `takeUntil`).
- ✅ Effects start in `onScopeInit` (DI) or `useEffect` (React), never in a constructor.
- ✅ Teardown functions are idempotent — React StrictMode runs the mount/unmount pair twice.
- ✅ Every `Signal.from(..., { keepAlive: "forever" })` has an owner that calls `dispose()`.
- ❌ Don't `dispose()` a signal you still write to; writes after dispose are silently dropped.
- ❌ Don't hunt for a `dispose()` on `LocalSignal` or `SourceSignal` results — they have none.
