/**
 * Type-level test: the library's `MachineStateSignal` of the proposal's
 * `square` and `trafficLight` definitions is assignable to `VizMachine`
 * without casts, and `<StatechartViz machine={...} />` typechecks. Verified
 * by `npm run ts-check`; vitest only asserts that the module loads. The
 * generated files of `./proposal/` (the converter's output for the fixtures,
 * kept fresh by `proposal/generated.test.ts`) are referenced through
 * `typeof import(...)`, which is erased at runtime.
